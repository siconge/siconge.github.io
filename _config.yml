          This project delivers an end-to-end data pipeline solution designed to process BIM (Building Information Modeling) data 
          from the Revit model of Tencent Global Headquarters in Shenzhen. Developed during the design and construction phases, 
          the pipeline efficiently handles unitized curtain wall metadata to support data-driven decision-making.

          Integrating upstream metadata extraction from Autodesk BIM 360 and downstream cloud-based transformations and analytics using AWS services, 
          the pipeline leverages Apache Airflow, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, and Amazon Redshift. 
          It enables automated, scalable workflows for data extraction, transformation, and storage.

          Tailored for design teams, technical consultants, and Tencent clients, the solution supports precise construction detail modifications, 
          cost estimation, and regulatory compliance with standards for energy consumption and fire protection. 
          Its modular and iterative BIM data processing approach adapts to evolving design requirements while preserving architectural integrity.

          This project presents a comprehensive and integrated real-world data engineering pipeline that leverages real-time transit data from 
          the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).
          
          The pipeline demonstrates the use of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and Change Data Capture (CDC) processes to ensure real-time data ingestion and storage, 
          as well as data synchronization across storage systems for efficient data replication and consistency. Utilizing a variety of data engineering tools and technologies, 
          including Docker, Apache Airflow, MySQL, MongoDB, and Python MySQL Replication, the pipeline supports real-time data availability, event-driven architectures, 
          and disaster recovery. This makes it an exemplary model for handling dynamic data in a production-like environment.
          
          In addition to real-time data handling, the pipeline also facilitates historical data analysis and visualization. 
          This enables time-series analysis and trend detection to provide insights into transit patterns, informing decision-making and optimizing transit operations.

          The Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS) is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau to gather data from retail businesses, 
          providing insights into the retail sector's performance. This data covers various aspects of retail, including sales and inventories. 
          
          This project has two primary goals: to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing on the MRTS dataset using Python and powerful data transformation libraries 
          like Pandas and SQLAlchemy, and to apply key time series analysis techniques, including trend analysis, percentage changes, and rolling time windows, to analyze the data of target businesses. 
          The process involves using MySQL for data retrieval and Python for detailed data manipulation and visualization.
