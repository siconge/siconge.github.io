          This project delivers a robust data pipeline solution designed to efficiently handle BIM (Building Information Modeling) data 
          from the Revit model of Tencent's Global Headquarters in Shenzhen. As the Lead Project Architect and BIM Data Engineer, 
          I oversaw the design and construction phases, ensuring seamless integration and data management.
          
          This data pipeline employs a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to move BIM data from Autodesk Revit into cloud storage for processing and analytics. 
          The pipeline leverages tools and services such as Apache Airflow, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Redshift.
          
          Specifically designed to serve the design team, technical consultants, and Tencent clients, this pipeline supports informed decision-making, 
          construction detail modifications, cost estimation, and compliance with local regulations such as energy consumption, window-to-wall ratio, and fire protection standards. 
          The focus on the unitized curtain wall system demonstrates how data-driven processes assist in fine-tuning design and construction details 
          to meet various code requirements while maintaining the overall design intent. This approach ensures precise tracking and management of architectural elements, 
          enhancing overall project outcomes.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project presents a comprehensive and integrated real-world data engineering pipeline that leverages real-time transit data from 
          the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).
          
          The pipeline demonstrates the use of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and Change Data Capture (CDC) processes to ensure real-time data ingestion and storage, 
          as well as data synchronization across storage systems for efficient data replication and consistency. Utilizing a variety of data engineering tools and technologies, 
          including Docker, Apache Airflow, MySQL, MongoDB, and Python MySQL Replication, the pipeline supports real-time data availability, event-driven architectures, 
          and disaster recovery. This makes it an exemplary model for handling dynamic data in a production-like environment.
          
          In addition to real-time data handling, the pipeline also facilitates historical data analysis and visualization. 
          This enables time-series analysis and trend detection to provide insights into transit patterns, informing decision-making and optimizing transit operations.

          The Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS) is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau to gather data from retail businesses, 
          providing insights into the retail sector's performance. This data covers various aspects of retail, including sales and inventories. 
          
          This project has two primary goals: to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing on the MRTS dataset using Python and powerful data transformation libraries 
          like Pandas and SQLAlchemy, and to apply key time series analysis techniques, including trend analysis, percentage changes, and rolling time windows, to analyze the data of target businesses. 
          The process involves using MySQL for data retrieval and Python for detailed data manipulation and visualization.
